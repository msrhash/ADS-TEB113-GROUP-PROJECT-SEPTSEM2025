## Description
The Smart KTMB Route Planner System helps users plan long-distance train trips more  easily by showing possible routes and required transfers between ETS and Intercity lines. The current system only searches for direct routes and returns “no available route” if none  exists. The improved system finds efficient routes, including transfers.

## How to run the program
1. Enter the origin station when prompted.
2. Enter the destination station when prompted.
3. The program will display either:
- Direct route found (baseline)
- Route found with all stations in the path (optimized)
- Route not found if no path exists.
4. After each search, you can choose to:
 - c – continue searching for another route
 - q – quit the program
